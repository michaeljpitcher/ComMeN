    Dynamics handles the simulation of events over a network.

    Simulations are run using the run function, which performs events using Gillespie algorithm, adapted from:
    D. T. Gillespie, "A general method for numerically simulating the stochastic time evolution of coupled chemical
    reactions," J. Comput. Phys., vol. 22, no. 4, pp. 403-434, 1976. **

    Each event calculates its rate, based on the assigned reaction parameter and the current state of the subpopulations
    of nodes in the network. Using these rates, a timestep interval is calculated and an event is probabilistically
    chosen. The event is performed and the network is updated. This continues until a time limit is reached or there are
    no events that can occur.
